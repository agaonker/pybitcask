# PyBitcask Milestones

## Vision

The goal is to evolve PyBitcask into a distributed keyâ€“value store with Riak-like features, including:

- A cluster of nodes (no single point of failure)
- Eventual consistency for updates
- Conflict resolution via vector clocks
- Data replication across nodes
- Fault tolerance for high availability

The end vision is a system that can run a local multi-node cluster and later be deployed on AWS.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Features
- [ ] Implement vector clocks for conflict resolution
- [ ] Add basic node-to-node communication
- [ ] Implement data replication between nodes
- [ ] Add cluster membership management

### Phase 2: Distributed Features
- [ ] Implement consistent hashing for data distribution
- [ ] Add quorum-based reads and writes
- [ ] Implement node failure detection and recovery
- [ ] Add anti-entropy mechanisms

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Implement backup and restore functionality
- [ ] Add security features (authentication, encryption)
- [ ] Create deployment guides for AWS

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add support for secondary indexes
- [ ] Implement MapReduce functionality
- [ ] Add support for complex queries
- [ ] Implement data compression

## Current Status

PyBitcask is currently a single-node key-value store with the following features:
- Append-only log storage
- In-memory index for fast lookups
- Thread-safe operations
- Data persistence
- Support for complex data types
- Tombstone-based deletion

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement vector clocks
2. Create basic node communication protocol
3. Implement data replication between nodes
4. Add cluster membership management
