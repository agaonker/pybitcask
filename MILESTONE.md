# PyBitcask Milestones

## Vision

The goal is to evolve PyBitcask into a distributed keyâ€“value store with Riak-like features, including:

- A cluster of nodes (no single point of failure)
- Eventual consistency for updates
- Conflict resolution via vector clocks
- Data replication across nodes
- Fault tolerance for high availability

The end vision is a system that can run a local multi-node cluster and later be deployed on AWS.

## Current Status

PyBitcask is currently a single-node key-value store with the following features:
- Append-only log storage
- In-memory index for fast lookups
- Thread-safe operations
- Data persistence
- Support for complex data types
- Tombstone-based deletion

## Next Steps

1. Design and implement log compaction
2. Create human-readable data format
3. Implement compaction scheduling
4. Add compaction metrics
