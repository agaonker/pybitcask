# PyBitcask Milestones

## Vision

The goal is to evolve PyBitcask into a distributed keyâ€“value store with Riak-like features, including:

- A cluster of nodes (no single point of failure)
- Eventual consistency for updates
- Conflict resolution via vector clocks
- Data replication across nodes
- Fault tolerance for high availability

The end vision is a system that can run a local multi-node cluster and later be deployed on AWS.

## Future Evolution

After completing the Python implementation and gathering production experience, 
we plan to pivot to a new language for the next generation implementation. 
This will be a new project that:

- Leverages the lessons learned from PyBitcask
- Takes advantage of modern hardware capabilities
- Implements new ideas and optimizations
- Focuses on performance and resource efficiency
- Provides a more robust foundation for distributed features
